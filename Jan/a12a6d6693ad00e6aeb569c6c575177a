Last year, amaBhungane started investigating the R4-billion-a-year Community Work Programme (CWP), which provides part-time work and training to 259 000 people across the country. We wanted to know if rumours were true that the project had become a feeding scheme for people connected to the department of co-operative governance and traditional affairs (Cogta) and its “implementing agents”.   So, we sent Cogta a Promotion of Access to Information Act request for records of the contracts that implementing agents awarded to a host of suppliers for tools, materials, protective clothing and training. Below, we publish a searchable database of those records and ask you to help us investigate who is eating the CWP. If you have information, email us at tipoffs@amabhungane.org or visit our tipoff page. You can also read our analysis of why the CWP is in trouble here or explore details of a covertly recorded meeting with the CWP official who said the State Security Agency had been asked to investigate leaks to a journalist here. For more stories in the days to come, keep reading www.amabhungane.org or follow the story with our publishing partner, Daily Dispatch. *Click here for the database, or search it below: <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>  * These records contain information from nine out of the 11 implementing agents. Cogta did not disclose records of two implementing agents on the grounds that they were subject to an ongoing investigation. We have digitised the original PDFs received from Cogta. During this process mistakes and duplications may have crept in. You can check the database against the original PDFs here. * Click on the evidence docket to access audio and video clips.
